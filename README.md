# GraphQLApi

GraphQL is a tool to simplify the server calls existing in the rest API calls.

**Schema** File is used to create your type (models, Query, Mutation), enum, and Input which is used in mutation methods.

**DataSources** files are used to differ usage of reading from file or rest APIs, etc., and it is also used to do your methods, either get (Query) or set (Mutation).

**Resolvers** are used to create adapters between the schema and calling the methods from the data source files we can also call It services.
